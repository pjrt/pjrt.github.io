If you have been writing Scala, chances are you have heard of type classes. In
fact, you may have heard of type classes even if you haven't been. You probably
have heard how they are "like interfaces"; but Scala has native interfaces
(traits) so why even use type classes (a thing that Scala doesn't have
natively)? In this post, we are going to explore type classes and then talk
about how they compare to interfaces/traits and why you might want to use
typeclasses.
